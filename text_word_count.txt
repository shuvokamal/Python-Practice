I am in the tech industry for only one year. I was a fresher when I joined Infosys one year ago straight from college. I got training from Infosys, then I worked as a contractor at an Insurance company for six months. Recently my project is finished and I came back to bench.

After one six months project, I think I know 'what' to learn! And I got to learn professional certificates has value. And undoubtedly Coursera is one of the biggest online credible Certificate providers.

I am focused on Big Data as I work in the Data and Analytical department. SO I need AWS training, and also some other technologies to excel my career. Having these certificates make sure that we contractors are hired quickly.

BTW, my company doesn't reimburse me for certification courses.
